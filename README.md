# reactor

A small demo of how to build a reactive framework based on Aeron.

It allows multiple components to send messages to each other and react on incoming messages.
The different components register themselves to a lookup service and can find each other using a simple REST interface.

The messages are currently serialized using a very rudimentary codec that is autogenerated from message classes based on 
getters and setters. Currently they can only contain primitive types and Strings.

TODO:

- remove unneeded stuff and trim the build system
- add configuration options instead of hardcoding everything in the code
- add more unit tests,
- allow distribution of the config via the lookup host
- add some stress tests and profile the code
- allow more complex datatypes in the messages
- use a code generator like JavaPOET
- set up some docker based tests
